It seems that in Davidson's mind the purported third dogma is somehow bound up with a puzzling use on my partof the phrase "conceptual scheme."The "dualism of schemeand content” deplored in my first quotation from Davidson bears a trace of this,as does the title of his essay. In con-clusion, then，let me clarify the status of the phrase. I inherited it some forty-five years ago through L.J. Hendersonfrom Pareto, and I have meant it as ordinary language, serving no technical function. It is not, as architects say, a supporting member. A triad-conceptual scheme, language, and world-is not what I envisage. I think rather，like Davidson, in terms of language and the world. I scout the tertiumquid as a myth of a museum of labeled ideas. Where I have spoken of a conceptual scheme I could have spoken of a language. where I have spoken of a very alien conceptualscheme I would have been content,Davidson will be glad toknow, to speak of a language awkward or baffling to translate.
